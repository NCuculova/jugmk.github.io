    Java Day is intended as small event but still it has major support by the leading companies in Information Technologies and Computer Science from Macedonia as well as EU based companies. The general idea is to have seven lecturers from experts in Java, Computer Science and related technologies. They will present new details and implementations of technologies in business and scientific development. Lectures are planned to have 60 participants who would have free access with prior registration. The participates mostly will be students and software engineers from Macedonia and neighboring countries. Priority will be given to regular JUGMK members and employees of supporting companies.
