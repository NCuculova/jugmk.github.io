    <h1>Welcome to the official website of JUGMK!</h1>
</div>
<p>
    JUGMK is an official group of Java users (both professionals and enthusiasts) in Macedonia. It's primary aim is to connect people that use Java, or are interested about it, share ideas, experiences and knowledge through regular meetings and technical conferences.
</p>
<p>
    Other goals include the promotion of the capabilities of the Java technology (as well as the surrounding Open Source technologies) and be one of the main promotors of Java and Open Source technologies in Macedonia.
</p>
<p>
    We are a part of Sun's Java User Group initiative, with legalized formal status of a Non-goverment organization (NGO) in Macedonia. We have a defined structure and are working with a supporter/sponsor based model. To see more information, be sure to check the About Us section.
</p>

    If you are interested in joining us, just subscribe to one of our mailings lists and start collaborating. Also, be sure to check the Events section to join us live on one of our regular meetings or technical conferences.

<p>We're looking forward to start collaborating with you!</p>
